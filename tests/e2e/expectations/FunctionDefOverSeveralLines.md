# FunctionDefOverSeveralLines

```java
public class FunctionDefOverSeveralLines
```

Here we test a function which has arguments over several lines

## `public void thisFunctionIsLongWinded(int a, int b, int c)` {#thisFunctionIsLongWinded}

Imagine this function name and arguments were longer, justifying the
need to break it up over several lines.

**Parameters:**

	* `a` - A
	* `b` - B
	* `c` - C
